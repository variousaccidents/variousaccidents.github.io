I hope you didn’t immediately try mixing coffee and wine. That’s not what I meant. Beyond the clickbaitiness of the
headline there is a general relationship between these two substances that goes beyond the flavor palettes and the time
of day you may find yourself consuming them.

## Both worlds, although literally night and day, are cultivated by people who care.

Over the years coffee and wine circles have upheld and continued to gain a reputation for focusing on the details. Both
tend to be rabbit holes full of experimental fermentation processes, exhaustive supply chain transparency, and an
out-of-this-world standard in snobby graphic design. Consequently the same kind of person who may care about the exact
source and brew of their energy nectar in the morning may be worrying about the working conditions for the producers of
their favorite glass of ferm juice later in the day.

## This is why you can sell them at the same place, and should!

…says Union Coffee and Wine in Seattle. Okay I’m putting words in their mouth but they did it. It’s incredible and makes
plenty of sense.

Pairing aesthetics makes a huge amount of sense, and listening to what other activities your audience does can help make
a marketing strategy much more well-rounded. These peeps are living that.
