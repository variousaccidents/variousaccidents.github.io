The Canadian electronic music producer well-known for a rigorous and pandemic-influenced isolationist work ethic and the fluid German audiovisual artist came together and did something wonderful.

Dusko formally joined the Twittersphere in 2019 all while cranking out an impressive catalog of self-works and collaborations. 
The collaboration shows a softer side of the producer, all while showcasing Sebastian Pfeifer’s incredible illustrative talent.
